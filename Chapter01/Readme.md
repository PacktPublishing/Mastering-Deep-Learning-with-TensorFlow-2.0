Deep learning is here to stay and so is TensorFlow, so Congratulations! on buying this book on mastering deep learning with TensorFlow. The book will take you deep into the TensorFlow ecosystem, we will build complex deep learning models using the TensorFlow APIs, and later learn how to deploy the models as mobile apps and websites. This chapter will act as a quick refresher to deep learning, we will build basic deep learning models using TensorFlow APIs. The chapter will also briefly introduce different components of the TensorFlow ecosystem.

In this chapter, we will be briefly cover the following topics:

* Installing TensorFlow
* Working in Google Colaboratory
* TensorFlow Ecosystem
* Building Convolutional Neural Networks
* Working with Recurrent Neural Network
* High-level Tensorflow libraries like Estimators, Hub, TensorFlow Serving
